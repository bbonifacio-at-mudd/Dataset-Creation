On both sides, one of the usual color-inserts is missing. Likely this means either a piece of the orange molded part broke off (or was never properly molded) before the green layer was added to the chip. TCR number is probably N0439.E2 but the description of the edge insert colors is ambiguous in the printed Rack. Show"
