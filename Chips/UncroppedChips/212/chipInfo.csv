Note that There is a 1st and 2nd issue of this chip and I feel they are reversed. I had a box of each and the ones with the 3 RED/MAROON edge inserts were noticeably more worn than the 3 RED/ORANGE in much newer shape. I do feel that the 3 RED/RAMOON inserts are the first issue and the newer 3 RED/ORANGE inserts are the 2nd issue. Show"
