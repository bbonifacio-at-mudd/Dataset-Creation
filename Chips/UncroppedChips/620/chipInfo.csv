Fuller lists 21 and slots only, I doubt they ever had roulette. I think they used their 1966 FM tokens for dollar
bets. Since they had 12 1/2 cent chips those ND chips were probably used as quarters. A blackjack would pay 37 1/2 cents. Johnny Jones had his complete collection of Morgan silver dollars displayed on the wall. Show"
